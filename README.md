# MegaClone
you need to 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

also install `megatools (on Windows I've downloaded it from chocolatey)` AND `megacmd from https://mega.nz/cmd` and add them to PATH

in RegisterMegaAcc.py add your [mailsac API key](https://mailsac.com/docs/api)

RegisterMegaAcc.py makes mega.nz account for you, and adds it to creds.txt file

Clone.py takes mega link as an argument and exports it on new account

Usage:

`python.exe .\RegisterMegaAcc.py`

`python.exe .\clone.py <Mega-Link>`
